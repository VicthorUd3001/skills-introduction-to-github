<h4>I'm Victhor the Undead. <i>I'm doing this name since the series Undead Unluck that I love is about to end in the time I'm making this. And I KNOW that bro's name is Victor not Victhor, but Victhor sounds cooler and gives his God like presence and aura.</i> Nice to meet you all. <i>Note from the me creating thi text, I didn't think HTML was needed to create this readme thing XD. Thanks web dev class. </i> I look forward to put my work here to share with you guys, though I questiont he fact that anyone might actually read this, doesn't matter or does it. Gotta leave a message in case someone does read this. XD.</h4>

<h5>In here I've added code from my first game in unity, which i'm proud of and will use in the future and laugh at how bad I was.</h5>
